# CryptoPeeps
CryptoPeeps are composed of 1,000 unique rare limited edition collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person as managed and verified by a contract running on the Ethereum blockchain. You can see which peeps are still available along with some more general information.
